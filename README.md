# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
-Data Source: election_results.csv
-Software: Python 3.9.1, Visual Studio Code 1.56.0

## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
  - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
  - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.

## Challenge Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given the additional task of generating results of a recent local congressional election by county. The parameters of this task must include the following:

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of counties in which votes were cast.
3. Calculate the total number of votes cast in each county.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes cast in each county.
5. Determine the county with the largest turnout based on the number of votes cast in the election.

### Code
This task includes the additional requirement of refactoring the Python code to generate the county analysis of the same dataset (see *Resources* above).

## Challenge Summary

### County Results
The election_analysis.txt file contains the output generated by the Python code used to conduct this analysis. The supplementary analysis of the election produced the following results:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election
- The counties involved in the election were:
  - Jefferson
  - Denver
  - Arapahoe
- The county results were:
  - Jefferson county produced 10.5% of the vote with 38,855 total votes.
  - Denver county produced 82.8% of the vote with 306,055 total votes.
  - Arapahoe county produced 6.7% of the vote with 24,801 total votes.
- The county with the largest turnout was:
  - Denver county which produced 82.8% of the vote with 306,055 total votes.

### Code
The original Python code can be found in the PyPoll.py file included in this package. The refactored code generating the additional county level results of the election can be found in the PyPoll_Challenge.py file. This code can be reused for additional election datasets provided they are structured similarly to the dataset provided for this analysis (see election_results.csv). Provided the inputs are structurally consistent with the dataset provided for this analysis, the refactored code will consistently identify election winners and county turnout at local, state, and federal levels.
